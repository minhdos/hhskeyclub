                                            Key Club, shockingly, does not make keys.
                                            In fact, the 'Key' actually stands for "Kiwanis Educating Youth."

                                            <br>
                                            ​Over seventy years ago, the global service club, Kiwanis International, created Key Club in hopes of inspiring youth to become active community members and leaders.
                                            Today, Key Club stands as one of the world's oldest and largest student-led high school service programs. Through countless volunteer opportunities, leadership roles, and service projects, members not only learn the value and the breathtaking language of service, they also have the opportunity to form lasting friendships and to develop themselves personally and professionally.

                                            ​At our heart, though, we are simply a community of fun-loving individuals who wish to bring a bit of light to other's days. We help people because we can, because we love to, and because we are people. We are people who care.

                                            ​Caring, it's our way of life.
